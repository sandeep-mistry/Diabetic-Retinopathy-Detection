# Diabetic Retinopathy Detection Kaggle Competition

# Introduction

We are given a large set of high-resolution retina images. 
A left and right field is provided for every subject. 
A clinician has rated the presence of diabetic retinopathy in each training image on a scale from 0 to 4, 
where 0 indicates no diabetic retinopathy detected and 4 indicates proliferative diabetic retinopathy detected. 
Our task is to create a system able to assign a score to new test images based on this scale.
