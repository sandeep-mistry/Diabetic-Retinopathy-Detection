- SVMs and k-NN used as automated methods for this porblem. 
- dropout important for preventing over fitting
- ImageNet & COCO challenge
- Sensitivity & Specificity
- Specificity: no. of patients correctly identified as not having DR our of the true total amount not having DR
- Sensitivity: no. of patients correctly idenified as having DR our of the true total amount of having DR. 
- Accuracy: no. of patients with a correct classification: 0,1,2,3,4
- This dataset with a high specificity has come with a trade off of lower sensitivity. 
- This network had a problem distinguishing between mild, moderate, and severe.
- Data set is skewed towards most images not showing DR, we have to accommodate for this
- Gardner et al further reading on neural networks (split image into patches before svm)
- Feature extraction is less time friendly than a CNN
- Increased convolution layers percieved allow network to learn deeper features e.g. last layers learns features of hard exudate
- Max Pooling performed with kernel 3x3 and 2x2 strides. 
- to avoid overfitting weighted class weights are used, relative to the amount of images in each class.
- Dropout performed on dense layers. until classification layer which uses softmax.
- leaky rectified linear unit activation function used to stop over reliance on certain nodes. 
- L2 reg used for weight and bisases in convolution layers.
- network initialised using gaussian initialisation.
- Loss function was categorical cross entropy. 
- Images were resized. 512x512
- Keras deep learning package was used with Theano machine learning back end. 
- Images preprocessed by colour normalisation with opencv. 
- network trained with SGD using Nestrov momentum.
- learning rate lowered by a factor of 10 every time training loss and accuracy "saturated"
- 10% of images in data set deemed ungradable by uk standards. 
- this method does not specifically make any use of features associated with DR.
