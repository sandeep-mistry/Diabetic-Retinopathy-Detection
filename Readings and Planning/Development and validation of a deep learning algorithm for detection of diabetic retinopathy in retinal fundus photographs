- Deep CNN
- Different dataset used in this paper
- This algorithm had high sensitivity and specificity for detecing diabetic retinopathy and macular edema in retinal fundus photographs
- parameters initially set to random values
- learned from pixel intensities
- comines nearby pixels into local features athen aggregates those into global features. 
- doesnt explicitly detect lesions.
Inception-v3 architecture proposed by Scegdy et al.
- preprocessed the data
- optimization algorithm to train weights was a distributed sgd implementation by Dean et al. 
- sped up training using batch normalisation, and preinitialised weights from the same networkd trained to classify objectsin the imagenet data set. 
- performance measured under AUC plotting 1-specificity vs snesitivity. 
- training stopped when peak auc is reached on a seperate tuning set.
- an ensemble of 2- networks trained on the same data was used, and the final prediction was computed by a linear average over the preditcions of the ensemble.
