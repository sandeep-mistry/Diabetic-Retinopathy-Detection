ECS GPU Server Deployment Guide
A set of instructions on how to connect to the ECS GPU server and run our code.

Required Credentials
<username> - UoS username (e.g. je5g15) without @soton.ac.uk
<password> - UoS password

1. Connecting
    Must be on the Southampton Eduroam network or using a VPN 
      (https://www.southampton.ac.uk/ageing/postgraduate/taught_courses/dl_welcome/vpn.page)
    In a terminal (or using Putty) ssh to <username>@yann.ecs.soton.ac.uk.
    When prompted, enter <password>
    You should now be connected to the GPU server. 

2. Clone Repo
    Navigate to a folder on the server where you want to host our code.
    Run `git clone https://git.soton.ac.uk/mna1u18/diabetic-retinopathy-detection.git`
    Enter required credentials for gitlab (should be the same as above)
    The repo should now have been cloned.

3. Run setup
    Move into the repo folder.
    Execute './setup.sh'
    This will download the dataset as a zipped file, and then extract the training and test data.
      The inflation of the zip file might take a while as it has to process a large number of images.
    If successful, you should now have two folders 'train_sub' and 'test_sub' containing images.
    This will also initialise a Conda environment.

4. Activate Conda environment
    Execute 'conda activate AML'
    This sets the conda working environment to the one just created.

5. Install required packages
    Execute './setup_env.sh'
    This will install all the packages in requirements.txt

6. Running code
    Ensure that the conda environment is active (conda activate AML)
    Execute 'python FILENAME'
